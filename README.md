# GraphQL Demo with .NET Core 7 and Hot Chocolate

This repository demonstrates the implementation of GraphQL in a .NET Core 7 project using Hot Chocolate. The application utilizes the PineStem Task Details table as an example for illustrating GraphQL functionalities

## Getting Started

GraphQL is an open-source server-side technology developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls. It serves as a query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing queries and collecting data from different sources.

### What is GraphQL?

- GraphQL allows us to fetch exactly the data we need using a single endpoint, optimizing API calls.
- It is strongly typed, enabling validation of queries within GraphQL before execution, contributing to building more robust APIs.
- GraphQL is known for its speed, stability, and ability to consistently provide predictable results.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphql-demo-dotnetcore.git
   cd graphql-demo-dotnetcore
   ```

2. **Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred code editor.**

3. **Set up your MySQL database and update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:**

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DBConnection": "Your_MySQL_Connection_String_Here"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Open your browser and navigate to [https://localhost:5001/graphql](https://localhost:5001/graphql) to access the GraphQL Playground.**

## Project Structure

- **Entities**: Contains the data models like `TaskDetails`.
- **Data**: Holds the `DbContextClass` responsible for database interactions.
- **Repositories**: Includes the repository interface (`ITaskService`) and its implementation (`TaskService`).
- **GraphQL**:
  - **QueryTypes**: Contains the GraphQL query types like `TaskQueryTypes`.
  - **MutationTypes**: Placeholder for future mutation types.
  - **Types**: Defines GraphQL types used in queries.

**Note**: For a detailed guide on the implementation, refer to the [Implementation Documentation](Implementation.md).

## GraphQL Queries

### Get Task List

```graphql
query {
  getTaskList {
    taskID
    taskName
    taskDueDate
    assignedTo
  }
}
```

### Get TaskDetails by ID

```graphql
query {
  getTaskDetailsById(taskId: 1) {
    taskID
    taskName
    taskDueDate
    assignedTo
  }
}
```
